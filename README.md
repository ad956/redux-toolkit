# Using React with Redux Toolkit: Todo App and Auth App Examples

In modern web development, combining React with Redux Toolkit has become a popular choice for managing state in complex applications efficiently. Redux Toolkit provides a simplified way to work with Redux by abstracting away much of the boilerplate code traditionally associated with it. Below, we'll explore two examples - a Todo App and an Auth App - to demonstrate how React and Redux Toolkit can be used together effectively.

## Todo App Example

### Overview

The Todo App is a classic example often used to demonstrate state management in web applications. In this example, we'll utilize React for building the user interface and Redux Toolkit for managing the application's state.

### Features

- **Add, Remove, and Toggle Todos**: Users can add new tasks, mark existing tasks as completed, and remove tasks they no longer need.
- **Filtering Todos**: Users can filter todos based on their completion status (e.g., all, completed, active).
- **Simplified State Management**: Redux Toolkit simplifies state management by providing utilities like `createSlice` and `createAsyncThunk`, reducing the amount of boilerplate code required.

### Technologies Used

- React
- Redux Toolkit

### Implementation Details

The Todo App's state will be managed using Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` to define a reducer and actions for adding, removing, and toggling todos.

## Auth App Example

### Overview

The Auth App focuses on user authentication and authorization. It demonstrates how to manage user authentication state using React and Redux Toolkit.

### Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out of the application.
- **Protected Routes**: Certain routes are accessible only to authenticated users, demonstrating how to handle protected routes using Redux Toolkit.
- **Persistent Authentication**: The app ensures that users remain authenticated even after a page refresh by storing authentication tokens securely.

### Technologies Used

- React
- Redux Toolkit
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication

### Implementation Details

The Auth App utilizes Redux Toolkit to manage authentication state, including actions for user login, logout, and registration. JWT tokens are used for secure authentication, and protected routes are implemented using React Router alongside Redux Toolkit to manage access control.

## Conclusion

By combining React with Redux Toolkit, developers can create powerful web applications with efficient state management and reduced boilerplate code. The Todo App and Auth App examples showcase how these technologies can be leveraged to build feature-rich applications with clean, maintainable code. Whether managing todo lists or implementing user authentication, React and Redux Toolkit provide a robust foundation for modern web development.
