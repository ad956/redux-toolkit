## Todo App Example

### Overview

The Todo App is a classic example often used to demonstrate state management in web applications. In this example, we'll utilize React for building the user interface and Redux Toolkit for managing the application's state.

### Features

- **Add, Remove, and Toggle Todos**: Users can add new tasks, mark existing tasks as completed, and remove tasks they no longer need.
- **Filtering Todos**: Users can filter todos based on their completion status (e.g., all, completed, active).
- **Simplified State Management**: Redux Toolkit simplifies state management by providing utilities like `createSlice` and `createAsyncThunk`, reducing the amount of boilerplate code required.

### Technologies Used

- React
- Redux Toolkit

### Implementation Details

The Todo App's state will be managed using Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` to define a reducer and actions for adding, removing, and toggling todos.
