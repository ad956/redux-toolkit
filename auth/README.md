## Auth App Example

### Overview

The Auth App focuses on user authentication and authorization. It demonstrates how to manage user authentication state using React and Redux Toolkit.

### Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out of the application.
- **Protected Routes**: Certain routes are accessible only to authenticated users, demonstrating how to handle protected routes using Redux Toolkit.
- **Persistent Authentication**: The app ensures that users remain authenticated even after a page refresh by storing authentication tokens securely.

### Technologies Used

- React
- Redux Toolkit
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication

### Implementation Details

The Auth App utilizes Redux Toolkit to manage authentication state, including actions for user login, logout, and registration. JWT tokens are used for secure authentication, and protected routes are implemented using React Router alongside Redux Toolkit to manage access control.
